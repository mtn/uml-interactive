# uml-interactive

Interactive sketches working through concepts and diagrams from [Understanding
Machine
Learning](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf).
I'm working on these as we read the book in a ML theory reading group at the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

## Setup

In a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html):

```bash
pip intall -r requirements.txt
```
